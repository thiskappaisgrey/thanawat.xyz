#+title: About Me
* Introduction                                                     :preamble:
Hi, my name is Thanawat. Right now I'm currently a student at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. I try to keep my life
interesting (as much as it can be) but because I am human, I go
through similar struggles as you do. I wanted to make this website
because I wanted to have a place to share my writings and my ideas, so
here it is.

* Research and Coding Interests                                    :research:
Right now, I'm doing a masters program at UCSB. I haven't worked on
any (public) research projects or started on my masters projects yet,
but here are some of interesting research topics I came across.

+ Equality Saturation and Datalog
+ Temporal Logic ( LTL, CTL, their extensions)
+ Dependent and Linear types

* My Interests                                                    :interests:

** Guitar
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
I started playing guitar in the 8th grade of middle school. It was one
of the new classes that the music teacher was teaching for the first
time at the school. He mainly taught classical music, so he didn't
know what he was doing, but I still learned some basics and also
learned to watch YouTube for inspiration. Honestly, I got a lot better
in the first year, and stagnated until I got to college. I was
learning and working on other things and I didn't have the energy to
learn new things on the guitar. Now that my life is a lot more settled
than it was, I hope to be able to learn more concepts on the guitar
and share some of my music with the world.


** Coffee
This is a hobby I think I picked up on the tail end of high school. I
knew I was going to be a coffee addict one day, so I might as well
enjoy the coffee I was drinking. Watching [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ][James Hoffmann]] was a big
influence for me. He kind of inspired me to get into grinding my own
beans and making some of my own coffee. I'm not any "good" (as in,
good enough to be a barista yet), nor do I have a lot of specialized
knowledge on the topic (yet anyways) but I hope to find some time to
learn more about it and to share some of what I learned here.

** Calisthenics
I was inspired to get into calisthenics (or body weight fitness)
because I wanted to get fit without being tied to a gym. It was in
high school where I discovered ~r/bodyweightfitness~ on Reddit, and I
tried to implement the recommended routine from there. However, I
never was really consistent with it until last year. Something that
really helped me stay consistent was to do the /bare minimum/. For me,
the recommended routine took way too long (I mean.. it's probably
because I got distracted on my phone between sets but like). Some days
I just was very busy with school or didn't feel like working out, etc.
So, what got me to become more consistent, is to keep my workout in a
journal and to "flex" every day in front of the mirror. The latter
sounds silly but it really helps because it helps cements your
identity as someone who is "fit"/ "healthy"(For those who've read
/Atomic Habits/, you might know what I'm talking about). Anyways, I
really want to one day be able to do some of the advanced moves in
calisthenics. For now though, I am content with getting more pull ups
and dips with each workout and just getting "stupidly strong" before I
start attempting to learn impressive skills.


** Technology
I think I have a pretty decent desk setup right now. Currently, I use
a Thinkpad T480 as my daily driver, an [[https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard][Keebio Iris]] split keyboard
(with lubed gateron clear switches, these are Linear switches with
minimal spring tension, for the ergonomics), a trackball and a
second monitor. I also have an audio interface that I plug in to my
laptop for my headphones (because I think it's supposed to help with
sound quality? I mainly use the audio interface to plug in my electric
guitar and my mic though. Actually, [[https://guitarix.org/][Guitarix]] is really great when
using virtual amplification. Very useful since I didn't want to carry
an amp all the way to University). Anyways, I think my tech setup is
very unique among the general population, however, I think that
there's probably people out there with more sophisticated tech setups
than mine! I also use the [[https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep][Ferris Sweep]] (not shown) when in travel,
since it's a much smaller split keyboard and much more portable than
the Iris. Actually, in University, I used the Sweep + Laptop combo
(without the second monitor most of the time, though I can carry it
around if I want to) a lot! It's a great portable set up for people
who enjoy the ergonomics.
