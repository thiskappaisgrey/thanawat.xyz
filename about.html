Right now I&#39;m currently a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I try to keep my life interesting (as much as it can be) but because I am human, I go through similar struggles as you do. I wanted to make this website because I wanted to have a place to share my writings and my ideas, so here it is. Hope you enjoy your stay and remember to smile lots.</p></div><h1>My Interests</h1><div class="aboutS2"><div class="imgSec"><div class="square"></div></div><div class="textSec"><h2>Guitar</h2><p>I started playing guitar in the 8th grade of middle school. It was one of the new classes that the music teacher was teaching for the first time at the school. He mainly taught classical music, so he didn&#39;t know what he was doing, but I still learned some basics and also learned to watch YouTube for inspiration. Honestly, I got a lot better in the first year, and stagnated until I got to college. I was learning and working on other things and I didn&#39;t have the energy to learn new things on the guitar. Now that my life is a lot more settled than it was, I hope to be able to learn more concepts on the guitar and share some of my music with the world.</p></div></div><div class="aboutS1"><div class="imgSec"><div class="square"></div></div><div class="textSec"><h2>Coffee</h2><p>This is a hobby I think I picked up on the tail end of high school. I knew I was going to be a coffee addict one day, so I might as well enjoy the coffee I was drinking. Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ">James Hoffmann</a> was a big influence for me. He kind of inspired me to get into grinding my own beans and making some of my own coffee. I&#39;m not any &quot;good&quot; (as in, good enough to be a barista yet), nor do I have a lot of specialized knowledge on the topic (yet anyways) but I hope to find some time to learn more about it and to share some of what I learned here.</p></div></div><div class="aboutS2"><div class="imgSec"><div class="square"></div></div><div class="textSec"><h2>Calisthenics</h2><p>I was inspired to get into calisthenics (or body weight fitness) because I wanted to get fit without being tied to a gym. It was in high school where I discovered <code class="org-highlight">r/bodyweightfitness</code> on Reddit, and I tried to implement the recommended routine from there. However, I never was really consistent with it until last year. Something that really helped me stay consistent was to do the <i>bare minimum</i>. For me, the recommended routine took way too long (I mean.. it&#39;s probably because I got distracted on my phone between sets but like). Some days I just was very busy with school or didn&#39;t feel like working out, etc. So, what got me to become more consistent, is to keep my workout in a journal and to &quot;flex&quot; every day in front of the mirror. The latter sounds silly but it really helps because it helps cements your identity as someone who is &quot;fit&quot;/ &quot;healthy&quot;(For those who&#39;ve read <i>Atomic Habits</i>, you might know what I&#39;m talking about). Anyways, I really want to one day be able to do some of the advanced moves in calisthenics. For now though, I am content with getting more pull ups and dips with each workout and just getting &quot;stupidly strong&quot; before I start attempting to learn impressive skills.</p></div></div><div class="aboutS1"><div class="imgSec"><div class="square"></div></div><div class="textSec"><h2>Technology</h2><p>I think I have a pretty decent desk setup right now. Currently, I use a Thinkpad T480 as my daily driver, an <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Keebio Iris</a> split keyboard (with lubed gateron clear switches, these are Linear switches with minimal spring tension, for the ergonomics), a trackball and a second monitor. I also have an audio interface that I plug in to my laptop for my headphones (because I think it&#39;s supposed to help with sound quality? I mainly use the audio interface to plug in my electric guitar and my mic though. Actually, <a href="https://guitarix.org/">Guitarix</a> is really great when using virtual amplification. Very useful since I didn&#39;t want to carry an amp all the way to University). Anyways, I think my tech setup is very unique among the general population, however, I think that there&#39;s probably people out there with more sophisticated tech setups than mine! I also use the <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep">Ferris Sweep</a> (not shown) when in travel, since it&#39;s a much smaller split keyboard and much more portable than the Iris. Actually, in University, I used the Sweep + Laptop combo (without the second monitor most of the time, though I can carry it around if I want to) a lot! It&#39;s a great portable set up for people who enjoy the ergonomics.</p></div></div></div></body>
