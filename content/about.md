Hi, this is a little bit about me
# Research Interests
Currently working on hardware decompilation using the [Egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog) through the [Churchroad](https://github.com/uwsampl/churchroad) intermediate representation for hardware netlists. 

Theoretically (if I get the opportunity or have enough interest) would like to work on / learn more about [String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08768) in the future.
