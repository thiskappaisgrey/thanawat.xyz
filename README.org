#+TITLE: Thanawat.xyz - My website
The Website is built using:
 - [[https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick#readme][Slick]] - a Haskell static site generator
 - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid][Lucid]]  - a Haskell library for generating HTML
 - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clay][Clay]]  - A Haskell library for generating CSS
 - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/org-mode][Org-mode haskell Parser]] - an org-mode parser written in haskell
This site also includes a ~live-server~ (which works for the most part) that:
- Load and Serve the website at: =localhost:3000=
- Reloads the web page (using websockets) if the haskell files changes.
* Build instructions
- This project is built using [[https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/tutorials/getting-started/][Haskell.nix]], to build, *make sure to first set up the binary cache(follow the link)* then do a ~nix-shell~ or a ~nix-build~.
- You can also install the packages using cabal too I guess.
